# Substrate Front End Template

This template allows you to create a front-end application that connects to a
[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) node back-end with minimal
configuration. To learn about Substrate itself, visit the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev).

The template is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and [Polkadot js API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/). Familiarity with these tools
will be helpful, but the template strives to be self-explanatory.

## Using The Template

### Installation

The codebase is installed using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). This tutorial assumes you have installed yarn globally prior to installing it within the subdirectories.Â For the most recent version and how to install yarn, please refer to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) documentation and installation guides. 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template.git
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```

## Usage

You can start the template in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.
